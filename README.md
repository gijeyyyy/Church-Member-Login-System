# Church-Member-Login-System
Members of the church can check updates from their church using this system, which is only available to them. As some members, particularly elders, have a tendency to forget information, it will also encourage everyone who has not yet been baptized so that they may always check updates whenever they need.
Members can only view updates in the system while administrators can view and edit updates.
